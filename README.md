<h1>American Sign Language (ASL) Detection</h1><br>
This project detects ASL hand gestures in real time using CNN and OpenCV. The model predicts ASL letters (A–Z) based on live webcam input and displays the recognized character on screen.<br>
<br>
**Features**<br>
- Real-time hand gesture prediction<br>
- Trained on ASL Dataset (CSV format) [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist]<br>
- Uses OpenCV to capture webcam input<br>
- Preprocessing includes grayscale conversion, resizing, and normalization<br>
- Supports classification of 26 ASL letters (A–Z)<br>
- ~81% accuracy on test data<br>
